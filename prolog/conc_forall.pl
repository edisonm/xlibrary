%!  conc_forall(:Cond, :Action)  is semidet.
%
%  Concurrent  version   of  forall/2.    This  predicate  will   prove  several
%  alternatives of Cond with Action, using multiple threads.  The maximum number
%  of  threads defined  is the  amount  of cores  available.  If  the number  of
%  pending jobs is greater than the number of workers, then the system will wait
%  until a job is finished before to  process the next alternative, this is done
%  to avoid that the alternatives of  Cond could overflow the memory.  Note that
%  this is different from concurrent_forall/3 in SWI-Prolog, since conc_forall/3
%  always execute the  tasks concurrently, which is needed in  some places where
%  the tasks needs to be isolated from each other.

conc_forall(Cond, Action) :-
    conc_forall(Cond, Action, true).

%!  conc_forall(:Cond, :Action, :Join) is semidet.
%
%   Join is called after the execution of Action in the main thread. Sometimes
%   we still need to execute a part of the code serialized.  Without concurrency,
%   it is equivalent to forall(Cond, (Action, ignore(Join))).
